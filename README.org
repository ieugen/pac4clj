* pac4clj -  pac4j for clojure ring

*pac4clj* is a Clojure library that integrates pac4j java library to Ring applications.

You can provide authentication and authorization to your Ring apps.

We don't plan to "hide" the Java nature of pac4j behind a clojure interface.
Just make it easy to implement auth in your app.
